## Overview
An Android app that helps landlords solve the problems faced by tenants. Tenants report the issues they face, and the landlord communicates with handymen to arrange for it to be fixed.

### Background
This was a group project for the UCF COP4331 class (Processes for Object Oriented Software Development) in Fall 2021. My group had four people, and we worked together to make this app.

### Design
The app was made with [React Native][react-native], which is a Javascript framework for making cross-platform applications. It communicates with a server made with [Express.js][express]. The server stores and retreives data from an [SQLite][sqlite] database.

### Lessons learned
- Google Docs is very useful for collaborating on documents
- Using pre-written libraries saves time
- Git branches make it easy for different people to work on different things without interfering with each other
- It is important to help each other in a group project
