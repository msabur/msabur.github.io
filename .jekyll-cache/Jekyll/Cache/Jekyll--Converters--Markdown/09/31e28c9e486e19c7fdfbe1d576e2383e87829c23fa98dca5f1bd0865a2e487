I"p<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A compiler for the PL/0 language, made as a group project for the Systems Software class at UCF in Summer 2021.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>The compiler has two parts: a lexical analyzer and a parser / code generator. A pl/0 program is first processed by the lexical analyzer, which breaks the program into tokens. The tokens then go into the parser / code generator, which generates “machine code”. We also made a virtual machine to run the generated code.</p>
