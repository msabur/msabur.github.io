## Overview
Website for events around a college campus. Users can create accounts, view events, and create events. Users see different events depending on the universities and organizations they are part of.

This was a project for the Database Systems class at UCF.

### Design
This is a full-stack web application written in JavaScipt. It consists of a backend (server) and a frontend (client). The frontend is written using the [React][react] library, and the backend is written using the [Fastify][fastify] library. The backend communicates with a Postgres database through SQL queries.
