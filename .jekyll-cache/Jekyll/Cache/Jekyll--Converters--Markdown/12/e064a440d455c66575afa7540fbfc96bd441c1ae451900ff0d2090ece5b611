<p>An Android app that helps landlords solve the problems faced by tenants. Tenants report the issues they face, and the landlord communicates with handymen to arrange for it to be fixed.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>This was a group project for the UCF COP4331 class (Processes for Object Oriented Software Development) in Fall 2021. My group had four people, and we worked together to make this app.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>The app was made with <a href="https://reactnative.dev">React Native</a>, which is a Javascript framework for making cross-platform applications. It communicates with a server made with <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express.js</a>. The server stores and retreives data from an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database.</p>
